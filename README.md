# The Ray Tracer Challenge

This is (the beginning of) my implementation of a ray tracer based on
the book The Ray Tracer Challenge by Jamis Buck. I have no experience
at all with this kind of thing, so I expect to either learn a lot in
the process or abandon the project early... (hoping for the former).

I am writing this in Clojure because it is my language of choice for
most things.

The current status is that I'm just getting started. Much of the code
will be quick and dirty initially, but should be easy to refactor
later. I don't want to settle on anything fancy just yet, because I
don't know how I'll be using even the basic abstractions like the
tuple. So for now it's just a map.

I feel the need to point out that the commit history of this project
does not reflect my usual work style. I'm making a ton of small
commits with very short descriptions. Mostly I'm using them as
checkpoints to get back to a working state after messing something
up. They're not intended to be helpful to readers (including myself).
